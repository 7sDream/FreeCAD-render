# Help plugin

Help plugin shows help on FreeCAD features.

This plugin is designed as an independant program that can be launched
separately from Render. The usual way to use it, however, is to run it from
Render virtual environment and embed it into FreeCAD Gui, via subcontainer.py.

The applet is based on broader dependencies than those provided by FreeCAD (for
instance, QWebEngine*). These dependencies are provided by Render virtual
environment.
