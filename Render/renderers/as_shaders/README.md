# OSL Shaders directory

This directory contains OSL shaders that are useful/necessary for the Appleseed plugin.
The shaders were essentially copied from the Appleseed application, in compiled (oso) format.
Exception:
The PyLa shader was obtained from http://vadrouillegraphique.blogspot.com/2013/05/pyla-physically-correct-layer-shader.html, in osl format, and compiled here (thanks to `oslc` compiler, see [here](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenShadingLanguage)).
